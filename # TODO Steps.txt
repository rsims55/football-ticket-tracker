# TODO Steps

## Need to systematically update the modeler (maybe with the weekly_update.py?)

## Send report
1. Build a weekly report
2. Create an action to send emails to me automatically
3. Save the report in the reports folder

## Make this compatible with Windows and Raspberry Pi 

## Optional - Create a graph that tracks current ticket prices
