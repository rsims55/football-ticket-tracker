## üí° Suggestions
- Miss rate >40% this week; consider revisiting hyperparameters or adding interaction features.
- Consider adding: team momentum (last 2‚Äì3 games), previous-week result diff, rivalry strength score, and weather (temp/precip).
- Explore time-of-day effects more granularly (hour buckets) and weekday/weekend splits.
- Check stadium capacity normalization (capacity vs. sold % if/when available).
- Timing: 15% of predictions occur *after* the actual low ‚Äî consider features about pre-game demand decay and listing churn.
- Near-zero importance this week (may be unrelated): collectionSlot, conferenceGame, neutralSite
